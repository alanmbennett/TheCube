To run:
	- On the Linux command-line, build the executable by typing in the 
	"make" command so the makefile will build it.
	- Then type in "./cube" to run with default parameters. Type in command line arguments to change
	default values. Example: "./cube –size 2 –seed 2 –teamA 1 –teamB 2"

To start game: 
	- Once program starts, type the "start" command to initialize all the wizard threads
	- After "start" command, type "s" for single-step execution
	- After "start" command, type "c" for continuous execution
	- Use "show" to show the current state of the map (if running continuous execution, 
	user won't be able to type commands until the game is over).
	- Use "exit" to exit program

NOTE: 
	- For continuous execution, it appears that threads will print out their current move multiple times.
	We were not able to find the cause of this behavior. Continuous works properly otherwise. Single-step 
	works properly printing and all.
