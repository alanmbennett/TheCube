Note for Anthony: 
	- DO NOT RUN IN XCODE, it won't work since the program needs
	to run with some libraries that must be specified on the Linux
	command-line. 
	- Just edit the .c files on your computer and then connect to the C4
	Lab Linux machines via SSH and test your code there. To transfer your 
	files to the C4 machine, connect to it with FileZilla and drop it in
	the desired directory.
	- Once you have verified that your changes are running correctly or
	whatever, push your code on your computer to the GitHub repo via 
	GitHub Desktop.

To run:
	- On the Linux command-line, build the executable by typing in the 
	"make" command so the makefile will build it.
	- Then type in "./cube" to run it. Be sure to remember the command-line
	arguments too!
